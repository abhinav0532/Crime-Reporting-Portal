# Cyber Crime Portal

The following project is a rough implementation of a Cyber Crime Portal where users can log in and Report/View all the recent Cyber Crimes reported by other users.

## Features

- Users can either register themselves or use Google Authentication(OAuth 2.0) to log in to use the portal.

- Passwords are encrypted using MD5 encryption.

- Users can view all of the latest incidents.

- Users can also report their own incidents and the Cyber Cell will take action accordingly.

- Contact information for all cyber cells is available in the Contacts section of the website.

- Users can also gather information about all the cyber laws in the About section.

- Users can also watch awareness videos in the Videos section to educate themselves on Cyber Crime.

## Known Bugs

Sometimes the Logout feature doesn't work effectively.

## Edit
> According to Google OAuth 2.0 Policies

For the purposes of these requirements, a "production" app meets the following criteria:

- It isn't for personal use. An app is considered to be for personal use if it's not shared with anyone else or will be used by fewer than 100 people (all of whom are known personally to you).
- It isn't used for development, testing, or staging.
- It isn't for internal use; that is, restricted to people in your Google Workspace or Cloud Identity organization.

> Since our website comes under personal use right now, Google OAuth 2.0
> doesn't work for everyone except for the people whose email ids are registered 
> within the API.
